# rock_paper_scissors

This is a game of rock, paper, scissors played in the console. It is rudimentary at this point, and contains very little styling. However, this allowed me to learn a lot about using simple Javascript including functions and a bit about for loops. I had to struggle my way through many problems which allowed me a deeper understanding of the task at hand.
